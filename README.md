# InterLocalRun

### Status: Working
After messing around with it fow an entire day, then using what I considered to be the best configuration, and leaving OpenCodeInterpreter over night with the task of creating a simple text based game, it didnt even create one file, so, I will probably wait a bit and try the next version. Development may be limited til then.
- Recent updates were..
1. fixed some error with manually inputting the context length, it seems to be able to auto-detect it, just letting it do that. 
2. enlarged interface, its suited to half a 1920x1080 display, the idea is the other half can be LM Server.
- Work remaining is..
1. re-formatting, use all the window for the menu.
2. Figure out the cache thing.
3. determine if any of the other arguments are useful.

### Description
This batch will automate some of the command line arguments for running OpenCodeInterpreter, its a program, somewhat similar to and maybe inspired by, AutoGPT.

â–Œ Open Interpreter is compatible with several local model providers.

[?] What one would you like to use?:
   Llamafile
   Ollama
 > LM Studio

To use use Open Interpreter with LM Studio, you will need to run LM Studio in the background.


Once the server is running, you can begin your conversation below.


> Please create a text based game about a character named Driftman; through text prompts the user can go to different locations in a generic town, where at each location, woods, lake, park, alley, shop, street, home, there will be a changing theme of the, public or authorities or criminals, whom will produce differing scenarios involving Driftman should he chooose to talk to them. You just need to, brainstorm it a bit and create a plan, then create the program, and give the differing, locations and groups and scenarios, a very very brief one sentence description. You should start by, brainstorming and planning, the project.

```

## Usage
1. Download and put the batch wherever you want OpenCodeInterpreter to be working.
2. Run InterLocalRun.Bat as Admin.
3. Select desired options from menu, `1-3` will run OpenCodeInterpreter.
- I advise do not use option 2 (Auto+Force) unless you are confident in, your prompt and the model. 

### Requirements
- By default it assumes, 4096 Max and 1024 Response, context, but If you select "C" from the menu you can change this, and it assumes you will want a response context 1/4 of the model context used.
- I advise using the [m-a-p/OpenCodeInterpreter-DS-6.7B](https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/OpenCodeInterpreter-DS-6.7B) language model, because of the leaderboard position and CPP and Memory Requirement/Speed.
- I advise running the model in [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), because it has installers for, Windows and Linux and Python. 

### Notation
- Edit this line "set /a context_window_947=%modelContext% / 4" to change the ratio of the response context. Maybe we need a option for thison the menu like "Response Ratio=R"?
